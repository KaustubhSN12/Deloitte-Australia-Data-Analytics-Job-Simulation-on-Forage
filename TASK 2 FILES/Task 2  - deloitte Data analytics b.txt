Here is the background information on your task
After a worrisome number of internal complaints about gender inequality in terms of salary, Daikibo Industrials wants us to help them investigate.

The Forensic Tech team has built an algorithm to quantify ‚Äúlevel of gender pay equality‚Äù for most job roles within the company, in all company locations. Our Forensics lead thinks it would be a great idea for you to finish the job.

Here is your task
We have processed all data on employee compensation and generated an Excel file (Equality Table.xlsx, available in the Resources) containing 3 columns:

Factory
Job Role
Equality Score (integer; ranging between -100 and +100; 0 is ideal)
Here is your task:

Create a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score into 3 types:
Fair (+-10)
Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)
Examples:

10 ‚Üí Fair
-9 ‚Üí Unfair
-30 ‚Üí Highly Discriminative
Please find the Equality Table you need to edit in the resources below. When you are done, upload the edited version of the file.

 

Here are some resources to help you

Equality table.csv

Solution:
==========

‚úÖ Step-by-Step in Excel

Open Equality Table.xlsx.

In Column D, add a new column header: Equality Class.

In cell D2, paste this formula:


=IF(ABS(C2)>20, "Highly Discriminative", IF(ABS(C2)>10, "Unfair", "Fair"))
üîç This formula checks:

If absolute score is greater than 20 ‚Üí Highly Discriminative

Else if greater than 10 ‚Üí Unfair

Else ‚Üí Fair

Drag the formula down to fill all rows in the dataset.

Double-check a few rows to make sure the classification looks correct.

Save the edited file with the same or a new name like Equality Table - Updated.xlsx
